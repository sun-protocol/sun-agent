SUN.io has become the largest asset issuance and trading platform on the TRON blockchain and serves as the core of TRON's DeFi ecosystem. The SUN.io platform integrates token swaps, liquidity mining, stablecoin exchange, and governance on the TRON blockchain, with a comprehensive focus on building a TRON DeFi system centered around DEX functionality.
To provide a smoother and more secure meme token trading experience and to let users effortlessly enjoy the charm of the meme ecosystem, SUN.io has launched the brand-new SunPump platform. As the first meme token launchpad dedicated to the TRON network, SunPump aims to offer creators a convenient and low-cost way to launch their tokens.
As the native token of SUN.io, SUN plays an important role in platform governance, buying back and burning rewards, offering rewards to liquidity providers and other features, and aligns with TRON’s aspiration to bring common benefits to all users.

All meme token contracts launched on the platform are fully transparent, with no presale and no team allocation. Users can freely browse the platform to discover meme tokens they are interested in and purchase them easily through a Bonding Curve mechanism, enjoying a flexible trading experience. As community participation and token purchases increase, the token’s market value is expected to rise steadily until it reaches 100% of the Bonding Curve (Market value is approximately 500,000 $TRX). Once this target is achieved, the platform will automatically deposit 100,000 TRX and 200 million tokens into SunSwap V2 as liquidity, and simultaneously burn the corresponding assets—empowering the token and boosting market confidence.",
